    <p><b>Celestial Waltz</b><br>

        Experience the ethereal beauty of the aurora dancing over Angel Rocks in the Chena River State Recreation Area near Fairbanks, Alaska. 
        <br>In this captivating scene, you look up towards the granite towers on the hillside above as the aurora's vertical streaks of green and pink intermingle with the blue sky. The heavenly display of lights creates an enchanting atmosphere showcasing this remarkable wonder of nature. The distinct colors of the aurora are caused by different atmospheric gases interacting with charged particles from the sun. </p>

    <p><b>Tors and Alaska Range</b><br>

        This breathtaking view is what I awoke to, with the majestic Alaska Range on the horizon, towering over the Granite Tors. Rolling hills covered in lush green spruce trees make up the foreground, while the sunlit hillside showcases scattered granite towers, rising high above the trees and catching the morning sunlight from the northeast. Despite being 90 miles away, the snow-covered Alaska Range looms impressively in the background, with the striking Mt. Moffit (13,020 ft. or 3,970 m) and Mt. Hayes (13,832 ft. or 4,216 m) dominating the landscape, creating an awe-inspiring panorama of nature's grandeur.
        
        Interestingly, I took this photo at 6:15 am in early May, with the sun already relatively high in the sky. On this day, the sun rose an hour and a half earlier, at 4:42 am. It takes some getting used to, backpacking and camping in the interior of Alaska in the late spring and summer since it never quite gets dark in the land of the midnight sun.
        
        The Granite Tors, located within the Chena River State Recreation Area, is a popular hiking destination for outdoor enthusiasts seeking the beauty of the Alaskan wilderness. The area offers a variety of hiking opportunities, with the main trail being the 15-mile Granite Tors Loop Trail. It makes for a fantastic overnight backpacking trip.

    <p><b>Peak Sunrise</b><br>

        This vibrant image captures a moment of awe as the sky erupts in fiery hues of pink and orange during a peak sunrise over the Alaska Dog Musher's Association trail system on the Creamer's Field Migratory Bird Refuge. The snowy field and tussocks of dry grass poking through the snow provide a contrasting foreground, while a small snow-covered marsh adds an element of tranquility to the scene. The stunning display of colors in the dark winter sky serves as a source of inspiration and a reminder of nature's enduring beauty. </p>

    <p><b>Cold River</b><br>

        A brave musher embarks on a chilly evening run along the Tanana River in Alaska. Bathed in the warm orange glow of the setting sun, only the silhouettes of the musher, his dogs, and distant trees were visible against the vibrant backdrop. The air is so cold at 40 below that the fog surrounding the dogs is actually their breath. This atmospheric image captures the spirit of adventure in Alaska and the bond between a musher and his team as they journey through the frozen landscape.</p>
