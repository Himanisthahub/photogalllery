    <p><b>Otterly Adorable</b><br>

      Over a dozen sea otters, nestled closely on a gleaming white iceberg, cast wary glances towards the camera, contemplating whether to relinquish their sunny perch. These icebergs, vast fragments of ice detached from the nearby Columbia Glacier, speckle the azure waters of Prince William Sound near Columbia Bay, providing opportune rest stops for local marine mammals such as otters and seals. The otters, undeniably endearing, frequently display expressions that can seem almost human-like, notably in moments of apprehension or playfulness, expressing concern, happiness, or pure curiosity.</p>
